## 🤯 Found Fun and Learned a Lot:
**The Shopkart - Marketplace (Collaborated Project)**

I learned greatly from my friends and from the errors I encountered during production (GitHub). Next.js was all new to me, and through their guidance, the mistakes made during coding, and pulling updates from GitHub, I grew significantly. YouTube tutorials and documentation were my go-to resources for learning Tailwind CSS.
- Designed and developed the front end using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive user experience.
- Collaborated with a team member to implement features for secure user registration and login.
- Gained practical experience in Tailwind CSS for styling and Next.js for framework usage, further showcasing strong UI development skills.

## 💬 Ask me about:
- Front-end development with React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
- Best practices for creating responsive and accessible web designs.
